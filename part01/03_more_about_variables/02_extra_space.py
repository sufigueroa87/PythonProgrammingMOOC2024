# Your friend is working on an app for jobseekers. She sends you this bit of code:
#
# name = "Tim Tester"
# age = 20
# skill1 = "python"
# level1 = "beginner"
# skill2 = "java"
# level2 = "veteran"
# skill3 = "programming"
# level3 = "semiprofessional"
# lower = 2000
# upper = 3000
#
# print("my name is ", name, " , I am ", age, "years old")
# print("my skills are")
# print("- ", skill1, " (", level1, ")")
# print("- ", skill2, " (", level2, ")")
# print("- ", skill3, " (", level3, " )")
# print("I am looking for a job with a salary of", lower, "-", upper, "euros per month")
#
# The program should print out exactly the following:
#
# my name is Tim Tester, I am 20 years old
#
# my skills are
#  - python (beginner)
#  - java (veteran)
#  - programming (semiprofessional)

# I am looking for a job with a salary of 2000-3000 euros per month
