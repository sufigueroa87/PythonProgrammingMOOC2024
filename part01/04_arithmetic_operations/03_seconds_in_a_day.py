# Please write a program which asks the user for a number of days. The program then prints out the number of seconds in the amount of days given.
#
# The program should function as follows:
# How many days? 1
# Seconds in that many days: 86400
#
# Another example:
# How many days? 7
# Seconds in that many days: 604800

days = int(input("How many days?"))
print(f"Seconds in that many days: {days * 24 * 60 * 60}")
