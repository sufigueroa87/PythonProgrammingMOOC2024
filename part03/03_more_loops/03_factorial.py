# Please write a program which asks the user to type in an integer number. If the user types in a number equal to
# or below 0, the execution ends. Otherwise the program prints out the factorial of the number.
#
# The factorial of a number involves multiplying the number by all the positive integers smaller than itself. In
# other words, it is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number. For example, the factorial
# of 5 is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.
#
# Some examples of expected behaviour:
#
# Please type in a number: 3
# The factorial of the number 3 is 6
# Please type in a number: 4
# The factorial of the number 4 is 24
# Please type in a number: -1
# Thanks and bye!
#
# Please type in a number: 1
# The factorial of the number 1 is 1
# Please type in a number: 0
# Thanks and bye!
