# Generally, any year that is divisible by four is a leap year. However, if the year is additionally
# divisible by 100, it is a leap year only if it also divisible by 400.
#
# Please write a program which asks the user for a year, and then prints out whether that year is a leap year or not.
#
# Some examples:
#
# Please type in a year: 2011
# That year is not a leap year.
#
# Please type in a year: 2020
# That year is a leap year.
#
# Please type in a year: 1800
# That year is not a leap year.

year = int(input("Please type in a year: "))

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print("That year is a leap year.")
        else:
            print("That year is not a leap year.")
    else:
