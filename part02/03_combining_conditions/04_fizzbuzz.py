# lease write a program which asks the user for an integer number. If the number is divisible by three, the program
# should print out Fizz. If the number is divisible by five, the program should print out Buzz. If the number
# is divisible by both three and five, the program should print out FizzBuzz.
#
# Some examples of expected behaviour:
#
# Number: 9
# Fizz
#
# Number: 7
#
# Number: 20
# Buzz
#
# Number: 45
# FizzBuzz

number = int(input("Number: "))

if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 != 0:
    print("Fizz")
elif number % 5 == 0 and number % 3 != 0:
    print("Buzz")
elif number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
