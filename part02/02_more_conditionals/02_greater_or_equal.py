# Please write a program which asks for two integer numbers. The program should then print out whichever is greater.
# If the numbers are equal, the program should print a different message.
#
# Some examples of expected behaviour:
#
# Please type in the first number: 5
# Please type in another number: 3
# The greater number was: 5
#
# Please type in the first number: 5
# Please type in another number: 5
# The numbers are equal!
